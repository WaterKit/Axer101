- 👋 Hey, I’m Axer101
- 👀 I honestly just like looking around every now and then, maybe for inspiration, maybe for help.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning raylib-python-cffi, so help may be useful
- 💞️ I’m not interested on collabartion. I prefer working alone, so only ask for help if you gain permission.
- 📫 You can reach me at Axer101@gmail.com, but I may not see your email
